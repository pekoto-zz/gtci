    "This pattern helps us solve problems that involve a list of sorted arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we have __k sorted arrays__, we can use a __heap__ to solve the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Push the smallest element for all arrays into a min heap to get the overall min\n",
    "2. While inserting, keep track of which array the element came from\n",
    "3. Then, when we get this element, we can push the next element from this same array\n",
    "\n",
    "__Hint__: Find the Kth smallest / largest thing in _multiple sorted lists_.\n",
