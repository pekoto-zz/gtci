    "Any problem that reduces to traversing a tree level-by-level can be solved with this technique.\n",

    "We use a __queue__ to keep track of the nodes at one level before jumping to the next level.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means the space complexity is __O(w)__, where w is the maximum number of nodes at any level.\n",

    "__HINT__: Looking for something at each level of the tree (max, average, last/first node at level etc).\n",

    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a binary tree, populate an array to represent its level-by-level traversal. You should populate the values of all nodes of each level from left to right in separate sub-arrays.\n",
