    "## Check if two interval overlap\n",
    "\n",
    "A common way to check if 2 intervals overlap is to check:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if a.start <= b.end and a.end >= b.start:\n",
    "    print(\"overlap\")\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "a = [2, 5], b=[1, 3]\n",

    "\n",
    "You know: a starts before b ends and ends after it starts.\n",

    "## Sorted Intervals\n",
    "\n",
    "If the intervals are already sorted, then all we need to do is check is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "if interval[i].end >= interval[i+1].start:\n",
    "    # Overlap\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Max Overlapping Intervals\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a common problem where we might have to find the max number of intervals that overlap. For example, min meeting rooms required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we can't just merge all of the intervals as you might have a case like:\n",
    "\n",
    "A overlaps B, B overlaps C, but A doesn't overlap C.\n",
    "E.g\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[1, 4] [3, 6], [4, 7] \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So the answer would be 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this, we can use a heap.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "def max_overlaps(intervals):\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # First, sort the intervals\n",
    "    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x.start)\n",

    "    for interval in intervals:\n",
    "        while len(heap) > 0 and heap[0][1].end <= interval.start:\n",
    "            # Remove all intervals that end before this one starts\n",
    "            heappop(heap)\n",
    "        \n",

    "__Warning:__ If 2 things in the heap have the same value for the value being compared, we get a unorderable types error. To get around this, we need to implement `__lt__` for the class being compared. \n",
